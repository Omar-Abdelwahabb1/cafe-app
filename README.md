INTRODUCTION:
This presentation outlines the development and implementation of a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for automating the deployment of a website from GitHub to a Kubernetes cluster. The pipeline leverages a variety of tools including Jenkins, Ansible, Docker, and Kubernetes to create a streamlined, efficient process that ensures the web application is continuously integrated, deployed, and updated based on changes to the source code repository.

Tools and Technologies Used:
Jenkins: Automation server used for building the CI/CD pipeline.
Ansible: Configuration management tool used to automate deployment processes.
Kubernetes: Container orchestration system for automating application deployment.
Docker: Containerization platform for deploying applications in lightweight containers.
GitHub: Source control platform used to store the application's code. 
Git: source version control system.
